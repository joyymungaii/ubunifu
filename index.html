        <h2>Developing the capacity to innovate.</h2>
        <p>
          We are a Premier Disruptive School of Artificial Intelligence,
          Software Engineering, Data Science, Robotics and Blockchain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a school where you graduate with your startup business and not
          only some worthless certificates. Ubunifu was built for those who want
          to innovate, those who think different and those who want to defy the
          status quo.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are fun, inventive and artistic, obsessed with outcomes and
          welcoming to anyone who has a dream.

            Our curriculum is delivered <br />by active industry thought

            Ubunifu's unique curriculum <br />is based on the Project
            <br />based Learning <br />methodology. Students <br />identify what
            they need to <br />build/work on and we <br />deliver through
            supported <br />work.

          <h3>Peer Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Learn by doing. Learn from <br />earch other. Always asking
            <br />“why,” we constantly <br />question the status quo. By
            <br />challenging ourselves and <br />one another, we’re building a
            <br />new kind of community.

        <h3>Do you think you <br />belong here?</h3>
        <p>
          Over the past 100 years, alot of areas in life have been
          <br />revolutionized but education is not one of them. Historically,
          higher <br />education has avoided competitive disruption. One reason
          for this <br />past immunity is the power of prestige in the higher
          education <br />marketplace, where the quality of the product is hard
          to measure. At <br />Ubunifu Our focus is to graduate all students
          innovation ready, ready <br />to solve problems creatively.
